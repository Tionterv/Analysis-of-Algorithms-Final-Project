***************************************
This program consist on solving 8 puzzle problem. The 8-puzzle consists of 8 tiles and one empty space where the tiles can be moved. 

The start configurations of the puzzle are provided in input.txt file and the puzzle can be solved by moving the tiles one by one in the single empty space and thus achieving the Goal configuration.

It finds a cheapest solution to the 8-puzzle. Given the initial state and the goal state of 8-puzzle, using BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra algorithms.

COMPILE: make puzzle
